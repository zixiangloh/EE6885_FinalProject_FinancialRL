\
This project uses the open source FinRL repository as the basis for our investigation. \
The FinRL repository is founded by the AI4Finance Foundation: https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation \
The FinRL repository is here: https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL \
\
The local finrl directory in this repository contains the modified ensemble model, which allows us to run an average action/policy ensemble.\
\
Please follow instructions in the FinRL repository for installing all the necessary python packages.\
\
The MVO.ipynb file contains code for running the Mean Variance Optimization (MVO) trading algorithm.\
The FinRL_Ensemble_StockTrading_ICAIF_2020-Modified.ipynb file contains the modified code for running the different ensemble methods and Shapley analysis for explainability.
